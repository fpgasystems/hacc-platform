## Coyote

Coyote is a framework providing operating system abstractions and a range of shared networking (RDMA, TCP/IP) and memory services to common modern heterogeneous platforms. Some of Coyote's features:

* Multiple isolated virtualized vFPGA regions
* Dynamic reconfiguration
* RTL and HLS user logic coding support
* Unified host and FPGA memory with striping across virtualized DRAM channels
* TCP/IP service
* RDMA service
* HBM support
* Runtime scheduler for different host user processes

The following picture shows the high level overview of Coyote's hardware and software architectures:
