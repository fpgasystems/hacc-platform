# Balboa

Balboa is a RDMA-stack for FPGAs which supports 100 Gbit networking and provides low latency and high throughput comparable to ASIC-based NICs. Since Balboa is completely compliant to the RoCE-v2 protocol, it allows RDMA-communication with any standard NIC and thus establishes the FPGA as a valid computing node in the network.
