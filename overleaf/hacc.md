## HACC

As a multi-core CPU, GPU, and FPGA cluster, ETHZ’s Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster (ETHZ-​HACC) allows research in distributed systems, databases, cloud computing, and hardware acceleration of data science. Internally, we are using ETHZ-HACC as the grounds to offer our HACC Platform to all our cluster users.
